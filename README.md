I created an infographic in Microsoft word to persuade customers that flying is safer than driving despite media controversial that bring traction that greatly affected the airline industry due to the downing of Malaysia Airline Flights 17 which fallowed the disappearance of its Flight 370 in recent years. In the infographic, I display 2-line charts along with some metrics that support my assumptions with two different datasets. I created the 2 charts in Power BI desktop with an initial airline safety dataset that was provided, and I did not modify it. I used a supplemental dataset that reported traffic fatalities for the city of Austin in 2015. I had to remove a couple of rows from it, and I changed the name of the columns to the original names that appeared in the csv format to achieve my goal because they showed up as columns after I loaded it in Power BI. The charts display results for fatalities by airline and number of car fatalities by day. The fatalities are highly unpredictable while the incidents are slightly predictable as you can see. I chose line charts to visualize both datasets because they are critical to show trends when visualizing data. For this audience, I present the statistics that back the story that flying is safer than driving. The data suggests that car fatalities largely surpassed plane fatalities. For instance, over 35000 people died in car accidents in 2015. The number of people died from plane crashes for the same year is 1040. On the other hand, the internal teams received a report that included all crashes and crash rates base on the number of accidents. In addition, the report noted presence, or absence of fatalities in the crashes.
